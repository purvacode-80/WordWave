                <h1> News Writing</h1>
           <h2>Introduction:</h2>
           <p>  News writing is a skill that’s used worldwide, but this writing format—with its unique rules 
                and structure—differs from other forms of writing. Understanding how to write a news story 
                correctly can ensure you’re performing your journalistic duty to your audience. </p>
           <h2>What is a news writing? </h2>
                <p> A news writing is a writing format that provides concise and factual information to a reader. 
                    News stories typically report on current affairs that are noteworthy—including legislation, 
                    announcements, education, discoveries or research, election results, public health, sports, 
                    and the arts.   </p>
                <P>Unlike blog and opinion posts, a strong news writing doesn’t include personal opinion, 
                    speculation, or bias. Additionally, the diction and syntax should be accessible to any reader, 
                    even if they’re not deeply familiar with the topic. News stories, therefore, don’t contain 
                    jargon that you might find in a research paper or essay</P>
