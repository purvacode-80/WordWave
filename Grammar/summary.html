                <h1> Summary Writing</h1>
            <p>A summary is a reproduction of a composition or a spoken matter. It is
                a version of an author's written or spoken matter rendered by another
                writer/person. In other words, a summary is an imitation as well as
                expression of any written or spoken matter rendered in one's own
                words and style.</p><p> In. a summary, a matter is reproduced in a condensed
                form. It can be called an art of compression of a composition. It is a
                type of composition too, which is composed upon another composition
                written by some author. In simple words, A summary means writing
                the subject matter of a passage or any piece of writing in a shortened
                form in one's own words and simple style</p>
                <p> A passage, either in prose or in verse, can be summarised. A poem, an
                    essay, a story, a dialogue, even a novel or a drama can be summarised.
                    An event of history, a topic of philosophy, an article on economics or
                    any subject can be summarised. Even a speech or a lecture of a person,
                    on "any matter, can be summarised. Summaries can be written on all
                    these things and also on other things. </p>
                <b> One should keep in mind the following points while he is writing a
                    summary :</b>
                    <ul class="sub_list">
                       <li> The summary should be written in prose. It should be written in one's own words and in a simple style. Sentences should not be quoted from the original piece </li>
                       <li>  It must be complete and self-contained in itself, i.e. it must convey its message fully and clearly. </li>
                       <li>  One should have to express the general meaning of the passage the piece. </li>
                       <li>  The faithful reproduction of the main theme is the first essential of a summary and compression is the second one.  </li>
                       <li>  There is no room in a summary for colloquial expression                 </li>
                       <li>  The summary should be written in simple, direct, grammatical and idiomatic English. </li>

                <h2>How to Write a Summary </h2>
                    <br>
                        <p>Summarizing, or writing a summary, means giving a concise overview of a text’s main points in your own words. A summary is always much shorter than the original text.</p>
                    
                        <p>There are five key steps that can help you to write a summary:</p>
                    
                        <ol>
                            <li>Read the text</li>
                            <li>Break it down into sections</li>
                            <li>Identify the key points in each section</li>
                            <li>Write the summary</li>
                            <li>Check the summary against the article</li>
                        </ol>
                    
                        <p>Writing a summary does not involve critiquing or evaluating the source. You should simply provide an accurate account of the most important information and ideas (without copying any text from the original).</p>
                    <br>
                        <h2>When to Write a Summary</h2><br>
                        <p>There are many situations in which you might have to summarize an article or other source:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>As a stand-alone assignment to show you’ve understood the material</li>
                            <li>To keep notes that will help you remember what you’ve read</li>
                            <li>To give an overview of other researchers’ work in a literature review</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <p>When you’re writing an academic text like an essay, research paper, or dissertation, you’ll integrate sources in a variety of ways. You might use a brief quote to support your point, or paraphrase a few sentences or paragraphs.</p>
                    
                        <p>But it’s often appropriate to summarize a whole article or chapter if it is especially relevant to your own research, or to provide an overview of a source before you analyze or critique it.</p>
                    
                        <p>In any case, the goal of summarizing is to give your reader a clear understanding of the original source. Follow the five steps outlined below to write a good summary.</p>
                    <br>
                        <h3><b>Step 1: Read the Text</b></h3><br>
                        <p>You should read the article more than once to make sure you’ve thoroughly understood it. It’s often effective to read in three stages:</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Scan the article quickly to get a sense of its topic and overall shape.</li>
                            <li>Read the article carefully, highlighting important points and taking notes as you read.</li>
                            <li>Skim the article again to confirm you’ve understood the key points, and reread any particularly important or difficult passages.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <p>There are some tricks you can use to identify the key points as you read:</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start by reading the abstract. This already contains the author’s own summary of their work, and it tells you what to expect from the article.</li>
                            <li>Pay attention to headings and subheadings. These should give you a good sense of what each part is about.</li>
                            <li>Read the introduction and the conclusion together and compare them: What did the author set out to do, and what was the outcome?</li>
                        </ul>
                    <br>
                        <h3><b>Step 2: Break the Text Down into Sections</b></h3><br>
                        <p>To make the text more manageable and understand its sub-points, break it down into smaller sections.</p>
                    
                        <p>If the text is a scientific paper that follows a standard empirical structure, it is probably already organized into clearly marked sections, usually including an introduction, methods, results, and discussion.</p>
                    
                        <p>Other types of articles may not be explicitly divided into sections. But most articles and essays will be structured around a series of sub-points or themes.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> To see at a glance what each part of the text focuses on, try writing a word or phrase in the margin next to each paragraph that describes the paragraph’s content. If several paragraphs cover similar topics, you may group them together.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Step 3: Identify the Key Points in Each Section</h3>
                        <p>Now it’s time to go through each section and pick out its most important points. What does your reader need to know to understand the overall argument or conclusion of the article?</p>
                    
                        <p>Keep in mind that a summary does not involve paraphrasing every single paragraph of the article. Your goal is to extract the essential points, leaving out anything that can be considered background information or supplementary detail.</p>
                    <br>
                        <h3><b>Step 4: Write the Summary</b></h3><br>
                        <p>Now that you know the key points that the article aims to communicate, you need to put them in your own words.</p>
                    
                        <p>To avoid plagiarism and show you’ve understood the article, it’s essential to properly paraphrase the author’s ideas. Do not copy and paste parts of the article, not even just a sentence or two.</p>
                    
                        <p>The best way to do this is to put the article aside and write out your own understanding of the author’s key points.</p>

                            <h3><b>Examples of Article Summaries</b></h3><br>
                            <p>Let’s take a look at an example. Below, we summarize this article, which scientifically investigates the old saying “an apple a day keeps the doctor away.”</p>
                    <br>
                            <h4><b>Example of a Full Article Summary</b></h4><br>
                            <p>Davis et al. (2015) set out to empirically test the popular saying “an apple a day keeps the doctor away.” Apples are often used to represent a healthy lifestyle, and research has shown their nutritional properties could be beneficial for various aspects of health. The authors’ unique approach is to take the saying literally and ask: do people who eat apples use healthcare services less frequently? If there is indeed such a relationship, they suggest, promoting apple consumption could help reduce healthcare costs.</p>
                    
                            <p>The study used publicly available cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants were categorized as either apple eaters or non-apple eaters based on their self-reported apple consumption in an average 24-hour period. They were also categorized as either avoiding or not avoiding the use of healthcare services in the past year. The data was statistically analyzed to test whether there was an association between apple consumption and several dependent variables: physician visits, hospital stays, use of mental health services, and use of prescription medication.</p>
                    
                            <p>Although apple eaters were slightly more likely to have avoided physician visits, this relationship was not statistically significant after adjusting for various relevant factors. No association was found between apple consumption and hospital stays or mental health service use. However, apple eaters were found to be slightly more likely to have avoided using prescription medication. Based on these results, the authors conclude that an apple a day does not keep the doctor away, but it may keep the pharmacist away. They suggest that this finding could have implications for reducing healthcare costs, considering the high annual costs of prescription medication and the inexpensiveness of apples.</p>
                    
                            <p>However, the authors also note several limitations of the study: most importantly, that apple eaters are likely to differ from non-apple eaters in ways that may have confounded the results (for example, apple eaters may be more likely to be health-conscious). To establish any causal relationship between apple consumption and avoidance of medication, they recommend experimental research.</p>
                        </div>
                    <br>
                        <h4><b>Example of a Concise Article Summary</b></h4><br>
                        <p>Using national survey data, Davis et al. (2015) tested the assertion that “an apple a day keeps the doctor away” and did not find statistically significant evidence to support this hypothesis. While people who consumed apples were slightly less likely to use prescription medications, the study was unable to demonstrate a causal relationship between these variables.</p>
                    <br>
                        <h3><b>Step 5: Check the Summary Against the Article</b></h3><br>
                        <p>Finally, read through the article once more to ensure that:</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>You’ve accurately represented the author’s work</li>
                            <li>You haven’t missed any essential information</li>
                            <li>The phrasing is not too similar to any sentences in the original.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <p>If you’re summarizing many articles as part of your own work, it may be a good idea to use a plagiarism checker to double-check that your text is completely original and properly cited. Just be sure to use one that’s safe and reliable.</p>
                                    <h2>Exercise:</h2><br>
                <P>Summarise the following passages :</P>  
                <div class="list_div">
                    <ol class="list_bullets">
                <p><li>    Malaria is carried by one kind of mosquito. If a man suffers from
                    malaria and a mosquito bites him it carries away some of the
                    germs of the [ diisease]. If this mosquito then bites a healthy
                    man, the germs may get into his blood and he may get malaria.
                    Mosquitoes lay their eggs in stagnant water. If there was no
                    stagnant water, there would be no mosquitoes, and so there
                    would be no malaria. Sometimes people put kerosene oil on
                    stagnant water and thus kill the mosquitoes before they are big
                    enough to flyaway. If everybody in Bangladesh took part in fight
                    against mosquitoes, we might soon get rid of malaria.</p></li><br>
                <P><li>Elephants are no longer used in war or by princes. At present
                    elephants are used mainly for the transport of timber and
                    bamboo in the mountainous parts of Bangladesh. As a result of
                    long experience we know a great deal about the habits of
                    elephants. We know, for example, that it rarely breeds in
                    captivity. How can we account, then for the thousands of these
                    animals used by the ancient kings and emperors of the subcontinent? The answer is that in those days they had to be
                    caught just as they are caught today</P></li><br>
                <P><li>When a boy George Washington was about to go to sea as a 
                    sailor, everything was ready. His box had been carried on the 
                    boat. When he came to his mother to bid farewell, he saw tears 
                    bursting from her eyes. However, he said nothing to her, but 
                    turned round to his servant and said, "Fetch my box back. I will 
                    not go away to break my mother's heart". His mother said, 
                    "George, God blesses the children who honour their parents. I 
                    am sure He will bless you". </P></li><br>
                <p><li>Oil has different uses in our life. If your skin is sunburn, rub some 
                    oil into it. Is your hair too dry? Put oil on it. Oil your bicycle to 
                    make it go well. Yes, oil is important in many ways but the kinds 
                    of oil which we use for different things may have different 
                    origins. No one would like a dinner cooked in engine oil. There 
                    are three main groups of oils animal, vegetable and mineral. 
                    Great qualities of animal oil come from whales, those enormous 
                    creatures of the sea which are the largest animals in the world. 
                    To protect the whale from the cold of the seas, nature has 
                    provided it with a thick covering of fat called blubber.</p></li><br>
                <p><li> Mohenjo-daro is nearly 400 miles to the north of Karachi and on 
                    the right bank of the River Indus. It is one of the oldest circles of 
                    the world. Few people -live there to day but 4,000 years ago it 
                    was a large, busy city. Nobody knew about it until 1922 when 
                    some villagers found some old pots and old bricks from the city. 
                    They took them to Sir John Marshall. He was interested in 
                    history, in ancient buildings and in old things. When he had 
                    looked at them, he said, perhaps they come from an old city. 
                    Perhaps there was once a town or a city at this place. Let us dig 
                    there. When we dig and take away the sand, perhaps we shall 
                    uncover the buildings of an old city.</p></li><br>

                        a knight. Taking a simple countryman named Sancho Panza as his 
                        squire, he walked about the country in search of adventures and 
                        did many comic things. One day Don Quixote and Sancho Panza 
                        were riding along a country road. Suddenly he saw a great cloud 
                        of dust moving towards them. Don Quixote turned to Sancho and 
                        said, "Oh, Sancho, today I shall perform such a daring deed that 
                        its fame will live for ages to come. Do you see that cloud of dust, 
                        Sancho? it is raised by a great army." "Why master," said Sancho 
                        "There must be two armies then; for on the other side, there 
                        rises another cloud of dust." </P></li><br>
                    <p><li> Once there lived a contented cobbler who passed his time in 
                        working and singing from morning till night. A neighbour of his, a 
                        wealthy banker said to him one day, "How much a year do you 
                        earn, my good friend?" The Cobber replied laughing, "How much 
                        a year, Sir? I never reckon in that way, living as I do from a hand 
                        to mouth; but some how each day brings its meal and I am 
                        happy." The banker then said, "I have resolved to place you 
                        above the fear of want. Take these hundred crowns, preserve 
                        them carefully and use them in time of need."The cobbler who 
                        had never seen so much money at a time in his life before, 
                        hurried home and buried his treasure in the earth for safety; but 
                        alas! </li></p><br>
                     <p><li> One hot day in summer a man hired an ass for a journey. The 
                            man rode the ass and the owner walked behind him. At mid-day 
                            the sun grew very hot. The rider got down to cool himself sitting 
                            under the shadow of the ass. The owner pulled him and said, "I 
                            have an equal right to the shadow with you." "What! said the 
                            man, "Have I not hired the ass for the journey? 1 have hired him 
                            and shadow goes with him." "You have hired the ass," said the 
                            owner. "But not the shadow" In this way they began to quarrel. 
                            At last from words they came to blows. During the fight one of 
                            the blows fell on the ass and  he ran away. </p></li><br>
                     <p><li> One day, at the age of nine, Mustapha was led by his mother to 
                                his father's bed side. There the father lay cold and silent in 
                                death. He was buried when the sun was sinking down to rest, 
                                then the mother with her children -a son and a daughter- had no 
                                means of livelihood. Starvation started them in the face. 
                                Mustapha had to give up his studies. An uncle gave shelter to the 
                                family. He lived in a far off village. Mustapha began to serve in a 
                                farm. He tended sheep and goats. His mother did not like her son 
                                to be a shepherd. So she again sent her son to a school at 
                                Salonica.</p></li><br>
                     <p><li>Edison never went to school. All education he ever got was given 
                                to him by his mother. At the age of twelve he was put to work on 
                                a railway. Having a great deal to do with newspapers, he 
                                managed to pick up the art of printing, and he printed a 
                                newspaper of his own "The Weekly Herald" in a luggage van. 
                                One day he rescued a station-master's child which was nearly run 
                                over by a train. The station-master, out of gratitude, taught him 
                                how to work the telegraph which had been introduced just then. 
                                Young Edison soon acquired great skill at the telegraph and was 
                                employed as a telegraphist. When only twenty, Edison invented a 
                                new telegraph which was extremely useful and several telegraph 
                                companies asked him to invent other things for them. </p></li>  <br>
                     <P><li>Books are man's best companions in life. You must have a 
                                    number of good friends but cannot get them when you want. 
                                    They may not speak gently to you; one or two may prove false 
                                    and do you much harm. But books are always ready to be by 
                                    your side. Some books may make you laugh, some others may 
                                    provide you much pleasure; others again provide you knowledge 
                                    and new ideas and make you noble. They are your friends 
                                    throughout life.</P></li><br>
                     <p><li>Once a Sultan wanted to find an honest man for collecting the 
                                    taxes of his kingdom. A wise counseller advised him to publish 
                                    abroad his need and invite all the application to the palace. He 
                                    told the Sultan that he would show him the honest officer when 
                                    the Sultan asked them to dance. The applicants came in time. 
                                    They were told "to advance to the Sultan all at a time through a 
                                    dark and empty corridor. When they all came before the throne, 
                                    the Sultan said, "Gentleman, I should very much like to see you 
                                    dance. " But all the applicants refused except one man, who 
                                    danced cheerfully and well. "This is the honest man," said the 
                                    counseller pointing to the dancer. In the dark corridor the wise 
                                    counseller had placed gold and coins and all the dishonest 
                                    applicants had filled their pockets as they passed through the 
                                    Sultan. If they danced, their pockets would have sounded being 
                                    shaken and so they refused to dance. </p></li> <br>
