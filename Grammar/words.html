            <section id="noun-section" class="lesson-section">
                <h1> Words </h1>
                <p class="def"> In traditional grammar, word is the basic unit of language. Words can be classified according to their action and meaning, but it is challenging to define. A word refers to a speech sound, or a mixture of two or more speech sounds in both written and verbal form of language. A word works as a symbol to represent/refer to something/someone in language to communicate a specific meaning. </p>
                <p> In linguistics, a unit of meaning underlying a group of inflected word forms is often referred to as a lexeme. For example, the verb forms 'love, loves, loved and loving' are mapped in the brain as inflected forms of a single unit of meaning, or lexeme, called 'love'. <br>
                A word can be just a letter (Examples: I, a) or one that contains multiple syllables (Examples: is, cat, about, theory, comfortable). Two or more words can be combined to form phrases and clauses, which in turn, can be put together to form sentences. There is, however, a particular word order and sentence structure one needs to follow to form meaningful sentences. <br> </p>
                <p>Example : 'love', 'cricket', 'sky' etc.</p> <br> <br>
                <p>' A word is the smallest unit of grammar that can stand alone as a complete utterance, separated by spaces in written language and potentially by pauses in speech.'</p>
                    There are several criteria for a speech sound, or a combination of some speech sounds to be called a word.
                    There must be a potential pause in speech and a space in written form between two words.
                    For instance, suppose 'ball' and 'bat' are two different words. So, if we use them in a sentence, we must have a potential pause after pronouncing each of them. It cannot be like “Idonotplaywithbatball.” If we take pause, these sounds can be regarded as seven distinct words which are 'I,' 'do,' 'not,' 'play,' 'with,' 'bat,' and 'ball.'
                    Every word must contain at least one root. If you break this root, it cannot be a word anymore.
                    For example, the word 'unfaithful' has a root 'faith.' If we break 'faith' into 'fa' and 'ith,' these sounds will not be regarded as words.
                    Every word must have a meaning.
                    For example, the sound 'lakkanah' has no meaning in the English language. So, it cannot be an English word. </p>
                <p> A word can be just a letter (Examples: I, a) or one that contains multiple syllables (Examples: is, cat, about, theory, comfortable). Two or more words can be combined to form phrases and clauses, which in turn, can be put together to form sentences. There is, however, a particular word order and sentence structure one needs to follow to form meaningful sentences. </p>
                <p> Word formation is divided into four categories based on the method of formation. These are:
                <div class="bullets_div">
                <ul class="custom-bullets">
                    <li> Prefix addition </li>
                    <li>Suffix addition</li>
                    <li>Word class conversion</li>
                    <li>Compound word formation</li>
                </ul>
                </div>
                <h3> Adding Prefixes : </h3>
                <p> The term 'prefix' refers to one or more alphabets added to the stem of a word, mostly to make it negative. The most commonly used prefixes include 'in-', 'un-', 'dis-', 'im-', 'ir-', etc. Look at the examples given below for a clearer understanding of how prefixes are used to form new words. </p>

                <h4> Examples of Word Formation by the Addition of Prefixes : </h4>
                <div class="list_div">
                <ol class="list_bullets">
                    <li> Discipline : indiscipline </li>
                    <li> Just : unjust </li>
                    <li> Tidy : untidy </li>
                    <li> Respect : disrespect </li>
                    <li> Understand : misunderstand </li>
                    <li> Comfortable : uncomfortable
                    <li> Comfort : discomfort </li>
                    <li> Responsible : irresponsible </li>
                    <li> Honest : dishonest </li>
                    <li> Happy : unhappy </li>
                    <li> Polite : impolite </li>

                    <li> Practical : impractical </li>
                    <li> Important : unimportant </li>
                    <li> Legal : illegal </li>
                    <li> Ethical : unethical </li>
                    <li> Potent : impotent </li>
                </ol>
                </div>
                <h3> Adding Suffixes : </h3>
                <p> A suffix is a short syllable added at the end of a base word. The addition of suffixes usually changes the word class of the particular word. The most common suffixes include '-ment', '-ness', '-ity', '-ous', '-tion', '-sion', '-al', '-able', '-ible', '-ive', '-ly', '-ate', '-er', '-or', etc. Check out the following examples to see how suffixes are added.</p>
                <h4> Examples of Word Formation by the Addition of Suffixes : </h4>
                <div class="list_div">
                <ol class="list_bullets">
                    <li> Comprehend (verb) : comprehension (noun) : comprehensible (adjective) </li>
                    <li> Inform (verb) : information (noun) : informative (adjective) </li>
                    <li> Invest (verb) : Investment (noun) : Investor (noun) </li>
                    <li> Write (verb) : writer (noun) </li>

                    <li> Wide (Adjective) : widen (verb) </li>
                    <li> Manage (verb) : manageable (adjective) : manager (noun) </li>
                    <li> Courage (noun) : courageous (adjective) </li>
                    <li> Brave (adjective) : bravery (noun) </li>
                    <li> Profit (noun) : profitable (adjective) </li>
                    <li> Quick (adjective) : quickly (adverb) </li>
                    <li> Happy (adjective) : happily (adverb) </li>

                </ol>
                </div>
                <h3> Converting from one word class to another : </h3>
                <p> The process of conversion focuses solely on changing the word class of the particular word. If you have noticed, you would have seen how some nouns are used to perform the role of a verb or an adjective acting like a noun just by the addition of another word or slightly altering the spelling of the actual word. </p>
                <h4> Examples of Word Formation by Conversion : </h4>
                <div class="list_div">
                <ol class="custom_bullets">
                <li> The rich should help the poor. <br>
                Adjectives such as 'rich' and 'poor' are used as nouns by using them with the article 'the'. </li>

                <li> Everyone is talented. <br>
                'Talented' - a past participle is used as an adjective in the above sentence. The word is formed by adding the suffix 'ed' to the end of the noun 'talent'. </li>

                <li> There will definitely be a lot of ups and downs in life. <br>
                Prepositions 'up' and 'down' are used as nouns by adding 's' to the end of it. </li>

                <li> He texted me about the meeting only at the last minute. <br>
                The noun 'text' used to refer to a text message sent on a phone is used as a verb in the sentence by adding an 'ed' to the end of the word. </li>

                <li> The financial aid had to be approved before we could make a decision. <br>
                The noun 'finance' is used as an adjective by adding 'ial' to the end of it and the verb 'decide' is used as a noun by removing 'de' and adding 'sion' to the word. </li>
                </ol>
                </div>
                <h3> Forming Compound Words : </h3>
                <p> Compound words are formed by combining one part of speech with another to form a specific word class. There are many ways in which compound words are formed. Verbs are combined with adjectives to form compound verbs, a present participle is combined with a noun to form a compound noun, two nouns are combined to form a compound noun, an adjective and a noun are combined to form a compound noun, an adverb is combined with a noun to form a compound noun, an adjective is combined with a past participle to form a compound adjective and so on. </p>
