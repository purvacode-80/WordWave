            <h1>Adjective</h1>
  
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        An adjective is a word that modifies or describes a noun or pronoun. Adjectives can be used to describe the qualities of someone or something independently or in comparison to something else.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Examples: Adjectives in a Sentence</h2>
    <div class="list_div">
    <ul>
        <li>I like old houses.</li>
        <li>The boy is tall and skinny.</li>
        <li>Jane is smarter than her brother.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <p>

    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>How Are Adjectives Used in Sentences?</h2>
    <p>
        Adjectives modify or describe nouns and pronouns. They can be attributive (occurring before the noun) or predicative (occurring after the noun). Predicative adjectives typically follow a linking verb (such as forms of the verb “to be”) that connects the subject of the sentence to the adjective.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples: Attributive and Predicative Adjectives</h3>
    <div class="list_div">
    <ul>
        <li>The proud soldier is home. (attributive)</li>
        <li>The soldier is proud. (predicative)</li>
        <li>The dedicated employee starts early. (attributive)</li>
        <li>The employee is dedicated. (predicative)</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> While most adjectives can occur in both the attributive and predicative positions, some can only be used in one position. For example, the word “main” can only be used in the attributive position, while the word “asleep” can only be used in the predicative position.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The main reason is that … (correct)</li>
        <li>The reason is main. (incorrect)</li>
        <li>The man is asleep. (correct)</li>
        <li>The asleep man is … (incorrect)</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Comparative and Superlative Adjectives</h2>
    <p>
        Comparative adjectives are used to compare two things. They’re usually formed by adding the suffix “-er” (or “-r” if the word ends in the letter “e”).
    </p>

    <h3>Examples: Comparative Adjectives in a Sentence</h3>
    <div class="list_div">
    <ul>
        <li>Simon’s essay is longer than Claire’s.</li>
        <li>The room is cozier with the fire lit and less cozy without it.</li>
        <li>I have never met a more honorable person.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h3>Examples: Superlative Adjectives in a Sentence</h3>
    <div class="list_div">
    <ul>
        <li>Even the greatest athletes need adequate rest.</li>
        <li>All the courses were delicious, but the dessert was the tastiest.</li>
        <li>Alicia is the most charming person at the party, but her partner is the least charming.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h2>Absolute Adjectives</h2>
    <p>
        An absolute adjective describes a state that cannot be compared, such as “dead” or “perfect.” However, actual usage varies, and absolute adjectives are sometimes modified by words like “almost.”
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Coordinate Adjectives</h2>
    <p>
        Coordinate adjectives are two or more adjectives that modify the same noun and can be separated by commas or the conjunction “and.”
    </p>

    <h3>Examples: Coordinate Adjectives in a Sentence</h3>
    <div class="list_div">
    <ul>
        <li>The plums were cool and delicious.</li>
        <li>Aaron wrote a heartbreaking, inspiring novel.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h2>Adjectives vs. Adverbs</h2>
    
    <p>
        Adjectives modify nouns and pronouns, while adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Adverbs are often formed by adding “-ly” to an adjective.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples: Adjectives and Adverbs in a Sentence</h3>
    <div class="list_div">
    <ul>
        <li>The man left <strong>early</strong>. (adverb)</li>
        <li>An <strong>early</strong> dinner. (adjective)</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h2>How to Order Adjectives</h2>
    <p>
        Adjectives in English typically follow a specific order:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Determiner (a, the, one)</li>
        <li>Opinion (beautiful, valuable)</li>
        <li>Size (big, small)</li>
        <li>Shape or Age (round, hundred-year-old)</li>
        <li>Color (white, red)</li>
        <li>Origin (Dutch, lunar)</li>
        <li>Material (wooden, glass)</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Other Types of Adjectives</h2>

    <h3>Appositive Adjectives</h3>
    <p>
        An appositive adjective occurs after the noun it modifies and is set off by commas.
    </p>
    
    <br>

    <h3>Compound Adjectives</h3>
    <p>
        A compound adjective is formed from two or more words. They are usually hyphenated when placed before the noun they modify.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Proper Adjectives</h3>
    <p>
        Proper adjectives are formed from proper nouns and are always capitalized.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Denominal Adjectives</h3>
    <p>
        Denominal adjectives are formed from nouns, often using a suffix.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Nominal Adjectives</h3>
    <p>
        Nominal adjectives function as nouns and are preceded by “the.”
    </p>

    <h3>Examples: Nominal Adjectives in a Sentence</h3>
    <div class="list_div">
    <ul>
        <li>The candidate appealed to both the rich and the poor.</li>
        <li>It’s important to take care of the elderly.</li>
    </ul>
