                <h1> Letter Writing</h1>
                <p>  <b>Introduction:</b></p>
                    <p>Letter writing has been deemed as one of the most useful forms learnt
                    and used for various reasons. There are several kinds of letters, each of
                    which has its own form and style. However, there are certain parts of
                    the letter which remain the same. </p>
                 <p>
                   <b>They include:<br></b></p>
                   <p><b>Sender’s address</b></p>
                   <p><b> Date</b></p>  
                  <p><b> Body of the Letter</b></p>  
                  <p> <b>Subscription</b></p>
                  <p> <b>Greeting or Salutation</b></p>
                  <p> <b>Signature </b></p>  
                   <p><b>Sender’s Address</b></p>
                   <p>The writer’s complete postal address has to be mentioned at the
                    beginning of the letter on the left-hand side of the paper. This lets the
                    receiver know where you wrote the letter from.</p>
                    <b>Date</b> 
                    <p>The date is written just below the sender’s address, and It lets the
                        recipient know when exactly the letter was written. The date may be
                        written in any of the following ways:</p>
                        <ul class="sub_list">
                            <li> 4th July 2005</li>
                            <li> July 4, 2005</li>
                            <li>  4/6/2005 </li>
                            <li>  4-6-2005 </li>
                            <li>   4-6-2005  </li>
                        </ul>
                    <b>Greeting or Salutation</b>
                    <p>The Salutation depends on the relationship between the sender and
                    the receiver.</p>
                    <p>To members of your family and friends, it could be Dear Father, My
                        Dearest Friend, Dear Uncle, Dear Diana, etc.</p>
                        <p>To Business people or any officer of higher rank, it could be Dear Sir,
                            Dear Sirs, Sir/Ma’am, etc.
                            </p>
                            <b>Body of the Letter</b>
                    <p>The message that you want to convey is stated in the body of the letter.
                        The style, however, depends on the type of letter you are writing. The
                        style of a friendly letter differs completely from that of a business letter
                        or an official letter, but there are certain points that apply to both
                        formal letters and informal letters.
                        </p>
                   <p>Generally, when you draft the body of your letter, see to that you
                    divide it into short paragraphs, according to the change in the subject
                    matter. Use simple and direct language that is easy to comprehend. Put
                    down all your points in a logical order. Mind your punctuation;
                    incorrect punctuation will alter the meaning of the sentence
                    completely.
                    </p>
                    <b>Subscription</b>
                    <p>The subscription helps you end the letter in a polite and courteous
                        manner. The subscriptions change according to the type of letter you
                        are writing. It can be written as Yours faithfully, Yours lovingly, Yours
                        sincerely, With love, etc.</p>
                    <b>Signature</b>
                    <p>The signature or the name of the writer should be written just before
                        the subscription.
                        </p>
                        
                             <h2> Different Types of Letters </h2> 
                             <p>Letters can be classified into two main types according to the purpose
                                of the letter. Informal Letters, also known as Social Letters, include
                                Friendly Letters and Notes of Invitations</p>

                                <img src="types_of _letter.jpeg" alt="types of letter">
                    <p>Formal Letters, also known as Business Letters, include Letters of
                        Application, Letters to Higher Authorities, and Letters to Newspapers.</p>
                   <h3>➢ Informal Letter:</h3>
                   <p>Letters to friends and family can be written in a conversational style.
                    They are just a composition of spontaneous thoughts, and they are
                    easy and personal. When writing an informal letter, you are free to use
                    colloquial language, which would be quite out of place in a formal
                    letter. This does not mean that you can pen down random thoughts
                    that are totally disconnected and make no sense. Wrong spelling,
                    punctuation and grammar are not allowed even though the letter is
                    informal and personal.
                    </p>
                    <p>An informal letter can be written by following a basic format that
                        includes the sender’s address, date, greeting, body of the letter,
                        subscription and signature. To know more about how to write an

            The result has proved that hard work, determination, and perseverance bring good results. You were so laborious and passionate about it.

            Hope to see you soon. Please be encouraged and continue your hard work. Your future is very bright. My parents and elder sister have sent lots of love and heartiest congratulations.<br><br>

            How have you been? I hope my letter finds you in best of health and spirits. It has been almost a month since I transferred to the boarding school. I am very happy in my new school. The classes and dormitories are very spacious. There are well equipped science laboratories and a library with a great collection of books. The school has amazing sports facilities such as swimming pool, horse riding track, and archery range.<br><br>
            I believe my life here will be interesting and enjoyable. Although I have made many new friends, I still miss you and the other friends. Please, pay my regards to your parents.

                        <h3>➢ Formal Letter:</h3>
                        <p>Formal letters or Business letters should be clear and concise. You
                            should always remember that formal letters are written to bring
                            important information into consideration, so you should always take
                            care to draft the letter carefully by providing only the necessary
                            information.</p>
                        <p>The language used in formal letters is a lot more professional than
                            informal letters. The format of formal letters is the same as explained
                            above, with a few additions, viz., ‘the Receiver’s Address’, ‘Subject’ and
                            ‘Signature’. Check out Formal Letter Writing in English for more

                                        Sir,<br><br>
                                        I would like to bring to your notice that the people in and around Cheran Nagar have been facing difficulties in travelling back and forth because of the bad condition of the roads there. We have appealed to the Municipality, but there has not been any response on the issue so far.<br><br>

                                        The situation is becoming worse. There have been multiple accidents happening due to this condition. I request you to highlight the seriousness of the matter in your newspaper so that the road may be properly repaired without further delay.<br><br>
                                        Thanking You
