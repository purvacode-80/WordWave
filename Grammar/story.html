                <h1> Story Writing</h1>
                
                <body>
                    <h2>Introduction of Story Writing : </h2>
                    <p>
                        Story writing refers to the method of writing in which the writer narrates a series of events that has led to a problem, the progression of the same and the end result that has led to the current situation of the characters in the story. A story can be about a real or fictional incident including real-life or imaginary characters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In schools, as part of the English language learning process, students are made to write stories. This is done to improve both the language skills as well as the students’ creative thinking skills. Story writing can turn out to be an interesting hobby once you experience the pleasure of developing a story. Learning to write a well-knit story can be made possible if you know the different components of a story and how to structure it.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>Components of a Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Is there anyone who does not like reading or listening to stories? As children, all of us must have gone to sleep listening to some bedtime stories narrated by our parents, grandparents or siblings, haven’t you? Now, have you ever wanted to write an exciting story just like the one you heard or read? Have you tried to analyse the components that make up the story? Any idea what the components are?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every story is expected to have the five components namely,<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Characters</li>
                            <li>Setting</li>
                            <li>Plot</li>
                            <li>Theme</li>
                            <li>Conflict</li>
                        </ul>
                        In addition to these, a story has a point of view in which it is narrated or portrayed and a style in which it is written. Let us now look at each of the components in detail.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Characters</h3>
                    <p>
                        No story is complete without a character. Every story would either revolve around multiple characters or a single character. Characters drive the story. Having strong characters of all types (funny, serious, clever, innocent, etc.) is what will make the story interesting and intriguing.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Setting</h3>
                    <p>
                        The term ‘setting’ refers to the physical surroundings in which the story takes place. The whereabouts of the characters might also contribute to the setting of the story. The setting of a story can be a forest, a house, a street, space or outer universe, a small island, a train and even someone’s mind. It is up to the writer to include all the details that they think would make the story more colourful.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Plot</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many of us are acquainted with the term ‘plot’, but what does the term mean? In simple terms, the plot of a story refers to what goes on in a story or what the story is about. A plot includes various courses of events/actions, climactic points and resolution. After all, a well-woven plot is what will help you form a good and strong story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A plot comprises five different elements, namely,
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Exposition</strong> – The point at which the characters and setting of the story are presented; in other terms, the beginning of the story.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rising action</strong> – The point in the story when the main character comes across an action or a course of events that becomes an impediment or a conflict in the otherwise undisturbed peaceful life of the main character and those around them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Climax</strong> – The most intriguing part of a story which also becomes the turning point of the story.</li>
                            <li><strong>Falling action</strong> – This includes actions or events that lead to the conclusion. This point describes the positive or negative turn of events that has taken place as a result of the protagonist’s decision at the climax. At this point, you can also see how the various characters work together or alone to solve the problem or conflict.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conclusion</strong> – This point in the story marks the end. It is here that you get to know how everything has settled. The conclusion, be it a happy or a sad one, is the end result of the falling action.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Theme</h3>
                    <p>
                        The theme of a story is the idea or subject that pervades the whole story. This is the concept on which the whole story revolves. Examples of themes can be family relationships, music, love and romance, war, rebellion, etc. For instance, the theme of the animated film ‘Coco’ is love for music and the importance of family, and the theme of the animated films ‘Brave’ and ‘Moana’ is breaking out of social norms and following your heart.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Conflict</h3>
                    <p>
                        The term ‘conflict’ refers to the problem in the story. When all is going on well, there is one point in the story when the main characters come across an obstacle that impedes their journey to achieve a set goal. The conflict is what gets the protagonist to move out of their comfort zone, face the antagonist, act bravely to solve the problem and find ways to attain their goal.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>Format of the Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Basically, every story should have a beginning, middle and end. A story without any one of these would look and sound incomplete.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just like every other piece of writing, the beginning of the story is what will determine if the reader would want to continue reading or not. So it is very crucial to have a rather riveting start. You have got to keep the readers hooked from the very first moment itself. The age-old and most common way to start a story is with the use of phrases like “A long time ago” or “Once upon a time”. You must have seen it being used in many children’s stories. However, this need not always be the case. You can start the story directly with the character introduction, the portrayal of the setting or even an action.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>The Middle</h3>
                    <p>
                        Beginning the story on a wonderful note and letting it drag later will not help the story in any way. You have to keep the story going. Make use of language cleverly, use literary devices and even the smallest detail if you think it will drive the story. Using descriptive language can further help to a great extent as it will give your audience a visual representation of everything that is going on in the story.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>The End</h3>
                    <p>
                        A good story writer knows when to drop the curtains for the readers. Similarly, if you want to write a good story, you must know when to wrap it up. You must have seen an open ending in many writings; that is also an option you can choose. Remember that you need not always provide a very pleasant ending or the ending that your audience might expect. You are free to end the story according to your discretion. The only thing you will have to bear in mind is to give the story the ending it deserves.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>Structuring Your Story – Guidelines to Writing a Good Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        When you sit down to write a story based on something that you have been thinking about for a long time now or just for the sake of it, the first thing you can do is brainstorm your ideas and pen your thoughts on a piece of paper or a notepad. Once you have noted down all of your ideas, here is how you can start structuring your story.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Who are your characters?</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is one of the most influential parts of the story. The diversity of your characters and the way you describe their characteristics will decide your reader’s interest in your story. Introducing the characters can be done in different ways – you can tell the entire story from one of the character’s point of view, include dialogues between various characters or even have a narrator introduce the characters and provide their background information.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Imperfect Character</h3>
                    <p>
                        No person is perfect, and neither should your character in a story. An imperfect character draws much more attention than a perfect character. Even a character who seems to be perfect will have a character flaw.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Vices of Character</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every person is made of virtues and vices, and that’s the reason most writers often choose their main characters to have vices that bring about their downfall or struggles that make their journey more interesting. By including the vices and the struggles of the character, the author can keep the readers glued till the very end. Suppose a character is arrogant, and that’s what causes his/her downfall, or a character struggles throughout the story to achieve the one thing that he/she wants. So if you want your story to capture the attention of the readers, then including vices or struggles can give you that edge.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Where is the story taking place?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Have you come across stories where the scene takes place on a stormy night, or the entire setting belongs to a particular period in history? While writing a story, you have to decide where you want your story to take place. After all, the atmosphere of a place can set the story’s tone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For instance, if the setting of the story is a dilapidated and abandoned house, the reader will immediately feel a chill down the spine as it seems eerie, and what happens next is totally unexpected. On the other hand, if you set your story in a calm locality with children playing around riding bicycles and old people walking down the street holding hands, it would give the reader a very pleasant outlook and make the reader feel extremely relaxed and comfortable.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>What is happening in the story?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Describe the environment and everything that is going on in the story. The way you portray each and every occurrence will give the readers a clear picture of what is happening. You ought to get the readers to feel one among the characters in the story; in other words, feel as if they are in the setting along with the characters and seeing everything around in person. This will kindle your story’s success.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>How does your story end?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The ending of the story is as important as the beginning. You can end your story in a happy or sad tone. Your story can even have a cliffhanger which might make it all the more exciting and leave it to the reader’s imagination. In case you are planning to write a sequel to the story, a cliffhanger is the best way to end the story as it will have the reader expecting one.
                    </p>
