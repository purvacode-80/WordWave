                <h1> Notice Writing</h1>
            <p><b><h2>What is notice writing ?</b></h2>
            </p>Notice writing is a formal method of communication
             used to inform people about important events, meetings, 
             announcements, or warnings. It’s often seen on notice boards in 
             offices, schools, housing societies, etc. Writing a notice 
             follows specific rules and formats to ensure clarity and 
             efficiency.
             <br>
             
        </br>
        <h2>Format of Notice Writing</h2>
    <p>Notice writing is the easiest writing piece that students can go for. Just like letters and articles, notice writing too has a particular format. In fact, marks are often allotted for the format itself during evaluation. So if you want to get full marks in notice writing, you have to learn how to design and present a notice that would fulfil its purpose.</p>

    <br><h3><b>Basic Elements of a Notice:</b></h3></br>
    <ul>
        <br><li><b>Name of the Organisation:</b> The first thing to write is the name of the organisation/school/college from where the notice is being issued.</li>
       <br> <li><b>Title:</b> The title for any notice writing is the word “Notice” itself.</li>
       <br><li><b>Date:</b> The next important thing that students must keep in mind while drafting the notice is to write the date.</li>
       <br><li><b>Heading:</b> The heading of the notice refers to the subject of the notice.</li>
       <br><li><b>Body:</b> The body contains the main content of the notice.</li>
       <br><li><b>Signature and Designation:</b> The notice ends with the signature of the person who composes the notice and their designation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br><h3><b>Tips for Notice Writing</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <br><li><b>No details:</b> Notice writing is not about details but about the exact information you need the readers to know.</li>
        <br> <li><b>Correct Heading:</b> Since the notice is meant for a large audience, it’s important that they understand what the notice is about.</li>
        <br><li><b>Format:</b> It is very crucial that the writer maintains the format of the notice.</li>
        <br><li><b>Clarity:</b> Even if notices are meant to be short, you have to make it clear to the readers what the notice wants to convey.</li>
    </ul>
