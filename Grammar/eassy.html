                <h1> Eassy Writing</h1>
            <p><b>Introduction: </b>
            An essay is a short piece of writing in prose. It consists of several 
            paragraphs. Each paragraph must contribute something to the 
            development of the topic of the essay. Here follow ten essays. An 
            outline precedes each essay and the points in the outline are 
            developed coherently. The essays are written as model ones. They are 
            not meant to be memorized by the students. The students should read 
            them carefully try to understand the methods of development and use 
            the methods in written their own essays. The notes that follow the 
            essays should be of help. </p><p>
            <b>Types of Essays: </b>
                <p> The type of an essay will depend on what the writer wants to convey to 
                    his reader. There are broadly four types of essays. Let us see.  </p>
                
                    <ul class="sub_list">
                       <b> Narrative Essays:</b><li>This is when the writer is narrating an incident or story through the 
                        essay. So, these are in the first person. The aim when writing narrative 
                        essays is to involve the reader in them as if they were right there when 
                        it was happening. So, make them as vivid and real as possible. One way 
                        to make this possible is to follow the principle of ‘show, don’t tell’. So, 
                        you must involve the reader in the story. </li>
                        <b>Descriptive Essays:</b>
                       <li>Here the writer will describe a place, an object, an event or maybe 
                        even a memory. But it is not just plainly describing things. The writer 
                        must paint a picture through his words. One clever way to do that is to 
                        evoke the senses of the reader. Do not only rely on sight but also 
                        involve the other senses of smell, touch, sound etc. A descriptive essay 
                        when done well will make the reader feel the emotions the writer was 
                        feeling at the moment.   </li>

                    <b>Expository Essays:</b>
                       <li>  In such an essay a writer presents a balanced study 
                        of a topic. To write such an essay, the writer must have real and 
                        extensive knowledge about the subject. There is no scope for the 
                        writer’s feelings or emotions in an expository essay. It is completely 
                        based on facts, statistics, examples etc. There are sub-types here like 
                        contrast essays, cause and effect essays etc.  </li>
                    <b>Expository Essays:</b>   
                    <li>  Here the purpose of the essay is to get the reader to 
                        your side of the argument. A persuasive essay is not just a presentation 
                        of facts but an attempt to convince the reader of the writer’s point of 
                        view. Both sides of the argument have to presented in these essays. 
                        But the ultimate aim is to persuade the readers that the writer’s 
                        argument carries more weight.  </li>
                       
                    </ul>

                <b>Format of an Essay: </b>
                <P>Now there is no rigid format of an essay. It is a creative process so it 
                    should not be confined within boundaries. However, there is a basic 
                    structure that is generally followed while writing essays. So let us take 
                    a look at the general structure of an essay.</P>
                <b>Introduction: </b> 
                <P>This is the first paragraph of your essay. This is where the writer 
                    introduces his topic for the very first time. You can give a very brief 
                    synopsis of your essay in the introductory paragraph. Generally, it is 
                    not very long, about 4-6 lines.</P>  
                 <P>There is plenty of scopes to get creative in the introduction of essays. 
                    This will ensure that you hook the reader, i.e. draw and keep his 
                    attention. So, to do so you can start with a quote or a proverb. 
                    Sometimes you can even start with a definition. Another interesting 
                    strategy to engage with your reader is to start with a question. </P>
                <b>Body: </b>
                <P>This is the main crux of your essays. The body is the meat of your essay 
                    sandwiched between the introduction and the conclusion. So, the most 
                    vital and important content of the essay will be here. This need not be 
                    confined to one paragraph. It can extend to two or more paragraphs 
                    according to the content. </P>
                <P>Usually, we have a lot of information to provide in the body. And the 
                    mistakes writers generally make is to go about it in a haphazard 
                    manner which leaves the reader confused. So it is important to 
                    organize your thoughts and content. Write the information in a 
                    systematic flow so that the reader can comprehend. So, for example, 
                    you were narrating an incident. The best manner to do this would be to 
                    go in a chronological order.</P>
                <b>Conclusion:</b>  
                <P>This is the last paragraph of the essay. Sometimes a conclusion will just 
                    mirror the introductory paragraph but make sure the words and syntax 
                    are different. A conclusion is also a great place to sum up a story or an 
                    argument. You can round up your essay by providing some moral or 
                    wrapping up a story. Make sure you complete your essays with the 
                    conclusion, leave no hanging threads.</P>

                <div class="list_div">
                    <ol class="list_bullets">
                    <p> <li>Give your essays an interesting and appropriate title. It will help 
                        draw the attention of the reader and pique their curiosity</li></p>
                    <p> <li> Keep it between 300-500 words. This is the ideal length, you can 
                        take creative license to increase or decrease it</li></p>
                    <p> <li>Keep your language simple and crisp. Unnecessary complicated 
                        and difficult words break the flow of the sentence.</li></p>
                    <p> <li>Do not make grammar mistakes, use correct punctuation and 
                        spellings. If this is not done it will distract the reader from the 
                        content </li></p>
                    <p> <li>Before beginning the essay organize your thought and plot a 
                        rough draft. This way you can ensure the story will flow and not 
                        be an unorganized mess.</li></p>
