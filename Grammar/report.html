                <h1> Report Writing</h1>
                
                    <h2>What Is a Report?</h2>
                    <p>A report is a document of the summary of an event, issue, or a topic. A report is never a fictional story. Writing a report aims to let the unaware readers know about a particular topic or idea. However, there is no particular definition of a report. Any discourse, written or verbal, covering a particular topic is known as a report. A report can be a courtroom confession or a child’s book report. But in general, when people talk about a report, it is more of an official document describing the facts of a topic, which is typically written by experts. The information regarding the event or topic must have enough evidence to support the statement. The data must be factually correct as it reaches various readers. A report must be written in an informative tone rather than opinionated.</p>
                <br>
                    <h2>What to Include in a Report?</h2>
                    <p>A report is a document which covers all the information related to the event or topic and includes all the factual information. Therefore, the one who writes a report must ensure that all the information provided has proper evidence for the same.</p>
                
                    <p>The information that can be added to a report include,</p>
                
                    <div class="list_div">
                        <ol class="list_bullets">
                        <li>The brief details of the event</li>
                        <li>Consequences and effects of the event</li>
                        <li>Evaluation of statistical data and analytics</li>
                        <li>Interpretations from the information</li>
                        <li>How the information is relevant to other events</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                <br>
                    <p>There is often a lot of confusion when it comes to report writing and essay writing, although there are clear differences between them. Both essays and reports are written based on factual information; essays include the personal opinion of the author; whereas, reports stick to the facts. However, reports also include the author’s interpretation of the topic in the conclusion of the report. The only difference is that these interpretations are objective. A report is a more systematic and organised way of writing which includes headings, subheadings, etc. and makes it easier for the readers to read. Essays, on the other hand, are mostly written in a single flow without subheadings or breaks.</p>
                <br>
                    <h2>Types of Reports</h2>
                    <p>Reports are classified into three main types depending on the purpose or motive behind the report. The common types of reports are</p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Academic Reports:</strong> This report tests the child’s comprehension ability. It tests if the student has understood the lesson and is able to comprehend the subject matter, such as books, historical events, biographies, etc.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Business Reports:</strong> It can be a marketing report, work report, etc., and the main purpose of writing the business report is to identify different business strategies.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Scientific Reports:</strong> Share research findings like case studies and journals.</li><br>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                    <h2>Report Writing Format and Structure</h2>
                    <p>The structure of a report depends on the type of report and the requirements of the report. The basic format for writing a report is mentioned below.</p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Executive Summary:</strong> Like an abstract in any academic paper, an executive summary is a standalone section of the report that summarises the whole of the report so that the readers know what to expect. These are mostly used in official reports.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> The introduction of the report plays a crucial role as it includes the main idea of the report. The main argument is discussed in the introduction before you put your points and the evidence is collected.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Body:</strong> The body comes after the introduction of the report. It includes all the information regarding the event or the topic. All the facts and evidence collected can be displayed in the body of the report. The body covers the major part of a report.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> It is the part of a report where all the information is gathered together, and your personal opinion or judgement is explained in this paragraph.</li><br>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Let us look at each of these in detail.</h3>
                <br>
                    <h3><b>1.Finding a Suitable Topic</b></h3>
                    <p>Before you can start writing your report, it is crucial to find the topic you wish to write on. In most cases, the topic is already given, and if not, you can find a suitable topic for the same. To find the topic, you must keep in mind that you must be interested in the topic and must be able to collect the required information.</p>
                
                    <h3><b>2.Conducting a Research</b></h3>
                    <p>Whatever the kind of report, academic, business, news, etc., healthy research must be conducted. Research is essential to find adequate information regarding the topic. Since a report includes all the factual data, extensive research is essential. It is essential to find the right evidence to prove your topic.</p>
                
                    <h3><b>3.Gathering all the Information</b></h3>
                    <p>After you are done with your research, you can jot down all the points at a place and note down all the facts collected. After collecting the information, you can decide on the subheadings and divide them as per their categories.</p>
                
                    <h3><b>4.Writing a Thesis Statement</b></h3>
                    <p>A thesis statement is written to conceptualise the main theme of the report. Just like the first sentence or the topic of the report, the thesis statement summarises the main points in brief.</p>
                
                    <h3><b>5.Preparing the Outline</b></h3>
                    <p>Preparing an outline of a report is essential for all the kids who are writing a report because you can categorise your important points and it becomes easy for you to decide on the headings and subheadings. It is essential to prepare the outline so that you do not miss out on the important points.</p>
                
                    <h3><b>6.Writing the Final Report</b></h3>
                    <p>After you have prepared the rough draft, you can start writing the final report. The final report must be written in simple language and in short sentences. The sentences must be short but convey the message clearly.</p>
                
                    <h3><b>7.Reviewing and Revising</b></h3>
                    <p>After the final report is written, it is crucial to revise and recheck if all the information has been added and you are not missing out on important information. Make sure to check if all the information has been added under the right heading and subheading.</p>
                
                    <h3><b>8.Editing and Proofreading</b></h3>
                    <p>After the final revision of the report, you must check the report for any grammar, spelling, and typographical errors. It is common that while writing, you might have overlooked a lot of mistakes. Therefore, final proofreading is essential.</p>

                                Mahatma Gandhi Animal Care Home is doing a mind-blowing job by understanding and fulfilling the needs of those who can’t speak for themselves. The experience was an overwhelming one.

                                GD Goenka School celebrated Independence Day with great enthusiasm and patriotic fervour. On the morning of August 14, 2021, our students presented hand-made greeting cards and tri-colour flag badges to the senior management functionaries of the school.

                                The cultural programme at school commenced with everyone singing ‘Vande Mataram’ followed by flag hoisting by the chief guest, Ms. Indu Bala Sharma, the District Magistrate. The spirit of freedom and nationalism was well exhibited by the students as well as the teachers through a spectrum of patriotic poems, speeches, quiz on freedom fighters, songs, and dance. Committed to the task of nation building, both faculty and student teachers pledged to serve their motherland through spreading education and serving the community. A presentation on the historical evolution of the national flag of India was shown. A documentary on the contribution of unsung heroes of the Indian freedom struggle like Tirupur Kumaran, Kamla Devi Chattopadhyay, and Khudiram Bose enlightened the audience. A few of them spoke on the history and significance of Independence Day and shed light on the special highlight of celebrations this year.

                                It ended with a speech by the principal on the topic, “What does freedom mean to me?” The celebration concluded with the inspiring words of the principal madam, followed by the National Anthem and the distribution of refreshments.
