            <h1>Paragraph Writing</h1>
           
    <h2>Introduction & Techniques of Paragraph Writing</h2>
<br>
    <h2>What is a Paragraph?</h2>
    <p>A paragraph is an important unit of composition. It is a group of sentences put in a systematic order. It may also be defined as a group of sentences that develops one particular idea. In other words, a paragraph develops a topic. Nowadays, a paragraph is treated as a type of short composition intended to be written by students. However, it should have a systematic beginning, middle, and conclusion. It can be an independent piece of writing on a particular topic or a part of a long composition.</p>

    
    <p> <b>• Let us note the following group of sentences: </b></p>
    <div class="list_div">
        <ol class="list_bullets">
        <li>I am proud of being a student of this school.</li>
        <li>It is in the district of Mymensingh.</li>
        <li>The school is famous for its good teaching and good results in the O-LEVEL Examination.</li>
        <li>I read in James High School.</li>
        <li>It has a beautiful building and a large playground in front of it.</li>
       <li>If we examine the group of sentences stated above, we'll comment that this is not a paragraph because the sentences are not put in a systematic order and so the idea is not developed in an orderly manner.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<br>
    <p><b> Now, let us rearrange the sentences:</b></p>
    <p>I read in James High School. It is in the district of Mymensingh. It was established in 1910. It has a beautiful building and a large playground in front of it. The school is famous for good teaching and good results in the O-LEVEL Examination. I am proud of being a student of this school.</p>
    <p>After rearranging the group of sentences, we can easily agree that it has become a paragraph because here is a coherent arrangement of the sentences and the idea is developed in an orderly manner. It develops a topic. The topic is "The school I read in".</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Types of Paragraphs</h2><br>
    <p>While the format of paragraphs should be similar, the type of paragraph will differ greatly depending on the type of writing being done. There are four common types of paragraphs and do not include paragraphs to separate dialogue. The table below gives details about the four types.</p>
    <br>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type of Paragraph</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Narrative</strong></td>
                <td>A narrative paragraph tells a story of a certain event and gives details that relate to the event being told.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Descriptive</strong></td>
                <td>A descriptive paragraph gives details about a person, place, thing, or idea. The topic sentence states what is being described and the details relate to that topic.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Expository</strong></td>
                <td>An expository paragraph gives information, explains something, gives directions, or shows how something happens. The detailed sentences in expository paragraphs often have linking words such as first, next, then, or after.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Argumentative</strong></td>
                <td>An argumentative paragraph, sometimes referred to as a persuasive paragraph, is where the topic sentence takes a specific position or request. The details are written to prove why the argument is valid.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>



    <h2>Format and Organization</h2>
    <p>A good paragraph consists of three important parts: the beginning, middle, and conclusion. These are the basic components of a paragraph. But a paragraph must be written as a single unit on a single idea.</p>

    <h3><b>The Beginning</b></h3>
    <p>The topic sentence usually forms the beginning of a paragraph. The sentence which reflects the topic of a paragraph is known as the topic sentence. It is usually the first sentence in a paragraph and is the most important sentence in it. A good topic sentence serves to introduce the topic and the controlling idea about the topic. Suppose, "Smoking Cigarettes" is the given topic of a paragraph to be written. In the beginning of the paragraph, we may write a sentence like "Smoking cigarettes is a bad habit". This is the topic sentence and "the bad habit of smoking cigarettes" is the controlling idea to which the writer will remain confined to write the paragraph. This idea will lead the writer to write the paragraph.</p>

    <h3><b>The Middle</b></h3>
    <p>The middle of a paragraph consists of the sentences placed between the topic sentence and the concluding sentence. These sentences develop the idea presented in the topic sentence by supporting, elaborating, and expanding it. The middle of a paragraph is also called the body of the paragraph.</p>

    <h3><b>The Conclusion</b></h3>
    <p>The last sentence in a paragraph usually serves as its conclusion. It logically concludes the idea developed in the middle of the paragraph. The beginning and the conclusion of a paragraph are related to each other, and there is a link between them.</p>

    <h2>Principles to Observe While Writing a Paragraph</h2>
    <div class="list_div">
        <ol class="list_bullets">
        <li>A paragraph must be written as a single unit.</li>
        <li>The sentences in a paragraph should be connected in a prosaic passage form; the sentences should not be detached from one another.</li>
        <li>The same point should not be repeated.</li>
        <li>It is better not to quote from any writer or philosopher.</li>
        <li>The sentences in a paragraph should be in the indirect speech.</li>
        <li>Though there is no hard and fast rule about the size of a paragraph, it may be limited to 100-150 words.</li>
        <li>All the sentences should be relevant to the topic of the paragraph.</li>
        <li>The sentences should be arranged in a proper and systematic order.</li>
        <li>The paragraph should be written in plain English with common and simple words.</li>
