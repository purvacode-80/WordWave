                <h1> Verbs </h1>
               
    <h2>What is a Verb in Grammar?</h2>
    <p>A verb is a word that tells what the subject is doing in a sentence. It indicates physical or mental actions, states of being, feelings, etc. Every sentence must contain one or more verbs. It expresses an action, occurrence, or state of being. Verb helps us to describe states of being or existence, like “be” or “exist”. Verbs can convey events such as “happen” or “occur”. In developing sentences, verbs need to be appropriate conjugate to match the tenses such as Past Tense, Present Tense, and Future Tense, Numbers such as Singular or Plurals, and persons such as First, Second, and Third of the subject.</p>

    <h2>Verb Definition and Examples</h2>
    <p>A “verb” is “a word or group of words that express an action (like eat), an event (like happen), or a state (like exist),” according to the Oxford Learners’ Dictionary. A “verb” is defined as “a word or phrase that describes an action, condition, or experience” in the Cambridge Dictionary. The definition of a verb is somewhat more detailed in the Collins Dictionary. “Words like sing, feel, or die are examples of verbs that are used with a subject to describe what someone or something does, what happens to them, or to provide information about them,” they say.</p>

    <h3>Examples of Verbs in Sentences:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>“She sings beautifully.” (The verb “sings” depicts an action.)</li>
        <li>“The cat is sleeping.” (The verb “is sleeping” portrays a state of being.)</li>
        <li>“He ran in the marathon.” (The verb “ran” conveys an action.)</li>
        <li>“I will study for the exam.” (The verb “will study” represents a future action.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Verbs represent a wide range of actions, like “be” or “exist”. Furthermore, verbs can show occurrences or events, such as “happen” or “occur”. It helps to communicate effectively.</p>

    <h2>General Classification of Verbs According to What They Signify</h2>
    <p>Before we get into a broad classification, let us first have a look at how verbs can be classified generally according to what kind of action they signify.</p>

    <h3>Verbs Referring to Actions</h3>
    <p>Verbs referring to action (action verbs) are those that involve the movement of one’s body in one way or the other. Some examples of verbs referring to actions are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Walk</li>
        <li>Run</li>
        <li>Talk</li>
        <li>Sit</li>
        <li>Read</li>
        <li>Write</li>
        <li>Jog</li>
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Sleep</li>
        <li>Jump</li>
        <li>Sing</li>
        <li>Drink</li>
        <li>Teach</li>
        <li>Present</li>
        <li>Build</li>
        <li>Break</li>
        <li>Tow</li>
        <li>Toss</li>
        <li>Hug</li>
        <li>Fight</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Verbs Referring to Experiences or Feelings</h3>
    <p>These are verbs that refer to something that you can feel or experience and do not necessarily involve a movement of any kind. Some examples of verbs referring to feelings and experiences are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Love</li>
        <li>Hate</li>
        <li>Envy</li>
        <li>Believe</li>
        <li>Trust</li>
        <li>Feel</li>
        <li>Entrust</li>
        <li>Experience</li>
        <li>Care</li>
        <li>Cherish</li>
        <li>Sense</li>
        <li>Know</li>
        <li>Recognise</li>
        <li>Understand</li>
        <li>Comprehend</li>
        <li>Like</li>
        <li>Need</li>
        <li>Adore</li>
        <li>Loathe</li>
        <li>Appreciate</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Verbs Referring to a State or Condition</h3>
    <p>These verbs are those that refer to situations or the state of being. All forms of ‘to be’ verbs belong to this category. Some examples of verbs referring to a state or condition are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Am</li>
        <li>Is</li>
        <li>Are</li>
        <li>Was</li>
        <li>Were</li>
        <li>Have</li>
        <li>Has</li>
        <li>Will be</li>
        <li>Appear</li>
        <li>Seem</li>
        <li>Become</li>
        <li>Been</li>
        <li>Being</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Recognize a Verb?</h2>
    <p>A verb is recognized based on the function in a sentence. Look for words describing actions. Note the following characteristics to recognize a verb:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change based on tense, person, and number</li>
        <li>Position within sentences</li>
        <li>Usage of modifiers, auxiliary verb, subject-verb agreement</li>
        <li>How verbs help form questions or negatives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Do You Use a Verb?</h2>
    <p>Every sentence contains a verb along with a noun or pronoun. A verb is essentially used to explain what the noun/pronoun is doing. Understanding how to use verbs correctly is essential for constructing grammatically accurate and meaningful sentences.</p>
    <p>The specific usage of verbs depends on the context, intended meaning, and grammatical rules of the language. These are fundamental components of sentences that provide the information about what is happening or being described.</p>

    <h2>Types of Verb</h2>
    <p>There are several types of verbs in English. Here are some common types with basic definitions and examples:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Action Verbs</strong>: This type of verb expresses physical as well as mental actions.
            <ul>

                <li>Mental action: think, believe, understand <br> Example: “I believe in myself.”</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Linking Verbs</strong>: These verbs form a bridge between the subject of a sentence and a noun, pronoun, or adjective that either gives it a new name or describes it.
            <ul>
                <li>Common linking verbs: be, seem, appear <br> Example: “He is a doctor.”</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Helping Verbs (Auxiliary Verbs)</strong>: These verbs assist the main verb in a sentence, expressing tense, mood, or voice.
            <ul>
                <li>Tense auxiliary verbs: have, be, do <br> Example: “She has finished her homework.”</li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Irregular Verbs</strong>: These verbs have irregular forms for their past tense and past participle. <br> Example: “She swam in the pool.”
